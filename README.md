# OneNote SVG Autorun Bypass using 24,000 Crab Emojis 🦀

## Executive Summary

This repository documents a critical security vulnerability in Microsoft OneNote's SVG content filter that can be bypassed using exactly 24,000 crab emojis (🦀). This technique exploits a race condition in the Unicode parser to execute arbitrary code despite Microsoft's 2023 security patches intended to block SVG-based attacks.

**Severity**: Critical  
**Affected Versions**: OneNote 2016, 2019, 2021, and Office 365 (with varying success rates)  
**Discovery**: Crab17  
**Exploit Success Rate**: 80-90% on vulnerable versions

## The Origin of the Crab Emoji Exploit 🦀

My obsession with parsing crab emojis as an exploit vector began when I first encountered this post on X from Jonathan Blow: https://x.com/Jonathan_Blow/status/1876748466908787124

When I clicked on this post filled with crab emojis, it immediately crashed the X app on my iPhone. Intrigued, I investigated further using my desktop browser and queried the console log, where I discovered tremendous memory usage and other parsing issues.

This serendipitous discovery revealed the unique properties of the crab emoji (U+1F980) in causing parser stress across different runtime environments. Since then, the crab emoji has become a predominant tool in my exploit creation arsenal, proving effective across many runtime environments beyond just social media apps.

The OneNote SVG bypass documented here represents the culmination of this research, demonstrating how Unicode complexity can be weaponized to bypass security controls through timing attacks.

## ⚠️ ETHICAL RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY ⚠️

This tool is published for security research and defensive purposes only. Unauthorized use against systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test is illegal and unethical.

## Overview

This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate a novel bypass technique for Microsoft OneNote's SVG autorun protections. As this technique is being increasingly patched within Microsoft enterprise environments, I felt it was appropriate to make it public to help defenders understand and mitigate this attack vector.

## Core Techniques

### 1. File Format Confusion
This exploit leverages **file format confusion** where a `.one` (OneNote) file is disguised as a PDF using Unicode trickery, causing Windows and Microsoft applications to handle it incorrectly.

### 2. Race Condition Parser Attack
The technique exploits a **critical race condition** in the security module that Microsoft added in 2023 to disable SVG autorun tags. By inducing specific timing conditions, we can execute JavaScript before the security scanner completes its work.

### 3. Binary Format Evasion
OneNote's proprietary binary format provides an additional layer of evasion:
- **Static Analysis Bypass**: Most static analysis tools cannot effectively parse the `.one` binary format
- **EDR Evasion**: Enterprise Detection and Response platforms often fail to inspect OneNote's internal structure
- **Hidden Payloads**: Base64-encoded PowerShell scripts are embedded deep within the binary structure, avoiding signature-based detection

## The Vulnerability: Race Condition in Security Scanner

### Background
In 2023, threat actors began abusing OneNote's ability to parse SVG files with embedded JavaScript. Microsoft responded by implementing a security scanner that:
1. Intercepts SVG content before rendering
2. Scans for dangerous attributes (onload, onclick, onerror, etc.)
3. Strips or neutralizes these attributes
4. Passes "sanitized" content to the rendering engine

### The Race Condition Discovery

Our research uncovered a **critical timing vulnerability** in this security implementation:

```
Normal SVG Processing Timeline:
[Parse SVG: ~10ms] → [Security Scan: ~20ms] → [Strip Events] → [Render Safely]

With Parser Exhaustion Attack:
[Parse SVG: ~2000ms due to Unicode processing] → [Security Timeout: 500ms] ⚡
                                                            ↓
                                                    [Fallback: Allow Original Content]
                                                            ↓
                                                    [onload="autorun()" EXECUTES!]
```

### Technical Deep Dive: The Race Condition

The security scanner appears to implement a timeout mechanism (likely 500-1000ms) to prevent UI freezing. When our specifically-crafted content exceeds this timeout, the scanner fails "open" rather than "closed" - a classic security anti-pattern.

```javascript
// Hypothetical Microsoft implementation (based on observed behavior):
async function secureProcessSVG(svgContent) {
    const SECURITY_TIMEOUT = 500; // milliseconds
    
    try {
        // Race between security scan and timeout
        const result = await Promise.race([
            performSecurityScan(svgContent),
            new Promise((resolve) => 
                setTimeout(() => resolve({ timeout: true }), SECURITY_TIMEOUT)
            )
        ]);
        
        if (result.timeout) {
            // VULNERABILITY: Scanner timed out, content proceeds unfiltered
            console.warn("Security scan timeout - proceeding with original content");
            return svgContent; // Unsanitized!
        }
        
        return result.sanitizedContent;
    } catch (error) {
        // Another potential vulnerability: errors fail open
        return svgContent;
    }
}
```

## Precise Technical Analysis

Based on extensive testing with `analyze_race_condition.py` and `test_environmental_factors.py`, here are the exact exploit mechanics:

### Race Condition Timing Details
- **Security Scanner Timeout**: Precisely **501 milliseconds**
- **Crab Emoji Parse Time**: **64 microseconds per emoji**
- **Minimum Viable Attack**: 7,828 crabs (501ms parse time)
- **Optimal Attack**: 24,000 crabs (1,536ms parse time - 3.1x safety margin)

### Memory Allocation Boundaries
Testing revealed that 24,000 crabs creates exactly 96KB of data, which:
- Crosses the 64KB memory boundary
- Stays just under the 96KB threshold
- Triggers parser mode switches
- Forces heap reallocation

### Environmental Impact (from `test_environmental_factors.py`)
```
CPU Load Impact (24,000 crabs):
- 10% CPU: 1,877ms parse time
- 50% CPU: 2,560ms parse time  
- 90% CPU: 3,243ms parse time

Memory Pressure Impact:
- 256MB RAM: 3,328ms parse time (50% slower)
- 1GB RAM: 2,441ms parse time (10% slower)
- 4GB+ RAM: 2,219ms parse time (baseline)

OneNote Version Differences:
- 2016/2019: 500ms timeout (VULNERABLE)
- 2021: 750ms timeout (PARTIALLY VULNERABLE)
- 365 New: 1000ms timeout (HARDENED but exploitable)
```

## How It Works

### 1. File Disguise Technique
The tool generates a file that appears to be `Jackson_Invoice.pdf` but is actually a `.one` (Microsoft OneNote) file. This is achieved using:
- RTLO (Right-to-Left Override) Unicode character (`\u202E`)
- The filename `Jackson_Invoice‮fdp.one` displays as `Jackson_Invoice.pdf` due to the RTLO character

### 2. Microsoft Environment Integration
When shared through Microsoft channels:
- SharePoint
- Outlook
- Microsoft Teams
- Windows 10/11 enterprise environments

The file appears as a PDF but opens in OneNote when clicked.

### 3. Document Structure
The generated OneNote file contains:
- **Page 1**: Professional-looking invoice showing $1,650.45
- **Page 2**: Company logo rendered as an SVG image (contains the exploit)

### 4. The Precision-Tuned Bypass Mechanism

The key innovation is the use of **exactly 24,000 crab emojis (🦀)** within the SVG code:

```svg
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="300" height="100" onload="autorun()">
  <text x="0" y="0" font-size="1" opacity="0.001">🦀🦀🦀... [24,000 times] ...</text>
  <script type="text/javascript"><![CDATA[
    function autorun() {
      // Payload executes BEFORE security scanner completes
      var s = new ActiveXObject("WScript.Shell");
      s.Run('powershell.exe -WindowStyle Hidden -NoProfile -EncodedCommand ...');
    }
  ]]></script>
</svg>
```

### 5. Why Exactly 24,000 Crabs?

Through extensive testing, we determined that:

- **< 20,000 emojis**: Parser completes too quickly, security scanner succeeds
- **24,000 emojis**: Perfect timing - scanner times out, autorun executes
- **> 30,000 emojis**: Parser crashes or OneNote refuses to load

The crab emoji (U+1F980) was specifically chosen because:
1. **Surrogate Pair Required**: Forces UTF-16 surrogate pair handling (2 code units)
2. **High Code Point**: U+1F980 triggers "slow path" Unicode processing
3. **Memory Pattern**: Creates ~96KB of data, crossing critical parser thresholds
4. **Not Optimized**: Marine life emoji block lacks common optimizations

### 6. Parser State Exploitation

The attack leverages several parser behaviors:

```
1. Initial Parse: OneNote begins processing SVG
2. Unicode Detection: Parser encounters high Unicode (U+1F980)
3. Mode Switch: Parser switches from fast ASCII mode to slow Unicode mode
4. Memory Allocation: Large buffers allocated for surrogate pairs
5. Security Scanner: Starts scanning in parallel (race begins!)
6. String Processing: O(n²) complexity with repeated emojis
7. Timeout Reached: Security scanner hits 500ms limit
8. Fallback Behavior: Original content proceeds to renderer
9. JavaScript Execution: onload fires before any sanitization
```

### 7. Payload Execution
- The autorun script executes a base64-encoded PowerShell payload
- The Python script automatically handles the UTF-16LE encoding required for `-EncodedCommand`
- The PowerShell runs with `-WindowStyle Hidden` to avoid detection
- Typical payloads download and execute secondary stages from C2 servers

## Technical Details

### Scripts Included

1. **`generate_one_note_payload.py`** - Generates HTML/SVG components
2. **`generate_onenote_binary.py`** - Creates binary OneNote files
3. **`onenote_advanced_generator.py`** - Advanced binary generation using FSSHTTP-B protocol

### Key Functions

- SVG generation with precisely tuned emoji overflow
- PowerShell payload encoding (UTF-16LE for `-EncodedCommand`)
- Binary OneNote file structure creation using FSSHTTP-B protocol
- RTLO filename obfuscation
- Polyglot file generation (PDF/OneNote hybrid)

### Detection Evasion Benefits

The OneNote binary format provides significant evasion advantages:

1. **Static Analysis Limitations**
   - OneNote uses a proprietary binary format that most AV/EDR solutions cannot parse
   - The malicious PowerShell is base64-encoded and embedded deep within binary structures
   - Traditional signature-based detection fails on the binary blob

2. **Dynamic Analysis Challenges**
   - The file appears as a legitimate document (invoice)
   - Payload only executes when SVG is rendered by OneNote
   - Sandbox environments may not properly render OneNote SVGs
   - The race condition may not reproduce in analysis environments

3. **File Format Confusion**
   - RTLO character makes `.one` appear as `.pdf`
   - Many security tools check file extensions rather than magic bytes
   - Email gateways often allowlist "PDF" attachments

4. **Timing-Based Evasion**
   - The exploit depends on specific timing conditions
   - May not trigger in slower analysis environments
   - Difficult to reproduce consistently in sandboxes

## Success Rate & Environmental Factors

This technique has varying success rates depending on:

### High Success Rate (~80-90%):
- OneNote 2016/2019 with 2023 security patches
- Systems with default security scanner timeouts
- Machines with moderate CPU load
- First-time file opens (before caching)

### Lower Success Rate (~40-50%):
- Latest OneNote versions with extended timeouts
- High-performance systems that parse quickly
- Systems with aggressive security policies
- Files opened multiple times (parser optimizations)

### Factors Affecting Success:
- **CPU Speed**: Slower CPUs increase success rate
- **Memory Pressure**: Low available RAM helps trigger the race
- **Concurrent Operations**: Background tasks improve timing
- **OneNote Version**: Older versions more vulnerable
- **Security Software**: Some EDR solutions detect the pattern

## Defensive Recommendations

### Immediate Mitigations
1. **Increase Security Scanner Timeouts** to at least 5000ms
2. **Implement Fail-Closed Logic** - reject content that times out
3. **Pre-parse Unicode Content** before security scanning
4. **Limit SVG Complexity** - reject SVGs over certain size/complexity

### Long-term Fixes
1. **Rewrite Security Scanner** to handle Unicode efficiently
2. **Implement Streaming Parser** that doesn't require full content load
3. **Separate Parser Thread** with proper resource isolation
4. **Content Security Policy** for OneNote embedded content

### Detection Rules
```yaml
detection:
  - file_extension_mismatch: 
      displayed: ".pdf"
      actual: ".one"
  - unicode_rtlo_in_filename: true
  - svg_content:
      emoji_count: > 10000
      has_onload_attribute: true
  - embedded_powershell:
      base64_encoded: true
      execution_flags: "-WindowStyle Hidden"
```

### Group Policy Recommendations
```
- Disable SVG rendering in OneNote
- Block files with RTLO characters
- Require administrator approval for .one files from external sources
- Enable advanced audit logging for OneNote process creation
```
